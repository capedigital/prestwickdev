                    <p>Tired of the way women are treated even at their progressive NYC high school, Jasmine and Chelsea create a club dedicated to empowering girls. They post their work online, from poems and essays to videos and rants, and soon go viral. But after the club receives unwanted attention from “trolls,” both online and in real life, the school principal shuts it down. Amidst threats to be silenced, Jasmine and Chelsea realize they must fight back if they want their voices—and those of other young women—to be heard.</p>

                    <p>Early in his career, Bryan Stevenson founded the Equal Justice Initiative, a legal practice for the poor, the wrongly convicted, and children. One of his first cases, that of a man sentenced to death for a murder he didn’t commit, drew Stevenson into a messy world in desperate need of compassion. This powerful, true story of one of America’s most committed lawyers examines the inequalities of the justice system through a life dedicated to defending those most in need.</p>

Both accessible and informative, this book educates readers about the history of racist ideas in America, from before the country’s founding to the present, explaining why racism continues to linger in society. It also discusses the insidious nature of racist ideas while offering ways readers can identify and end racist thoughts—conscious or not—in their daily lives.</p>
